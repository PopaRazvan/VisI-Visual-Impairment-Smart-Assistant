            John is a software engineer facing challenges due to his myopia. Despite using corrective eyewear, he
            experiences eye strain, headaches, and blurred vision. He discovers an app designed for individuals with
            visual
            impairments, which allows him to adjust text size and magnify code segments for better visibility. The app
            also
            provides visual customization options, helping him reduce eye strain while coding and navigate software
            tools
            efficiently.

            John is a talented UX designer in his thirties. With over a decade of experience, he specializes in creating visually appealing and accessible user interfaces. However, his red-green color blindness poses challenges in accurately perceiving color combinations, impacting his design process.

          <p>
            John often struggles to differentiate between certain colors, which can result in unintended design flaws. He relies on colleagues to verify color choices, reducing his independence and slowing down the design process. Additionally, he feels limited in expressing his creativity fully due to the impact of his color perception on the overall design.

        <p><strong>1. </strong>John is working on a new project that requires a color palette with shades of red and green. He uses a color blindness simulation feature in an app to identify color combinations that are difficult for him to distinguish. With this information, he adjusts the color palette to ensure a more accessible design.</p>
        <p><strong>2. </strong>John is collaborating with a team on a web application. He utilizes the text resizing feature of the app to enlarge the font size, making it easier for him to read and review the code. This feature enhances his productivity and reduces eye strain.</p>
